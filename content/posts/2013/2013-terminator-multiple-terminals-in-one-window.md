[Terminator](http://www.tenshu.net/p/terminator.html) is a handsome python implementation of a terminal emulator, that 
supports [tiling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager), which is awesome. This means, several terminals 
are arranged in one window <a href="/blog/terminator.png"><img border="0" src="/terminator.thumb.png" /></a>
