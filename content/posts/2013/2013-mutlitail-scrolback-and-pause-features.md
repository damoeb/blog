The two probably most important features in multitail (via [pantz.org](http://www.pantz.org/software/multitail/multitailconfig.html)).  

## Pause

> To pause all the logs **press the "p" key**. 

## Scroll back
> To use the log windows scroll back feature **press the "b" key** and select the log you want to scroll back through. 

Maybe you will need those commandline options `-mb x`. Set scrollback buffer size (in bytes, use xKB/MB/GB). 
**-M nlines**  Set the buffersize on ALL following files.
