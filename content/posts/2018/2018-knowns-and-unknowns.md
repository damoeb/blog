In a talk [0] by the battlesome philiosopher Slavoj Zizek, he mentioned a classification of knowledge, of which especially the Unkown-Knowns catched my interest.

*   Known-Knowns: things we know that we know
*   Known-Unknowns: things that we know we don't know
*   Unkown-Unknowns: things we don't know we don't know
*   Unknown-Knowns: "The things we don't know that we know-which is precisely, the Freudian unconscious, the "knowledge which doesn't know itself," as Lacan used to say. ". This is better known as culture.
