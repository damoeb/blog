( I already had [some thoughts on that topic](https://yellowchicken.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/engineering-dashboard/)Â ).

# Goal

*   Get a better overview of future/pending/past work and keep it.
*   "If you want a developer to do something, e.g. establish a high test coverage, make it easy with sane reasons"

# What?

*   Pre-Deployment
    *   Feature Branches, consisting of
        *   PRs
        *   Build
            *   (Test) Reports
            *   Static Code Analysis (Report?)
            *   Build Status green/yellow/red
        *   Human Code Analysis (Code Reviews)
*   Post-Deployment
    *   Monitoring
        *   Active (Alerts)
        *   Passive
    *   Configuration
        *   Feature Flags?
