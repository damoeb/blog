*   Write (small) notes, using note sequences to develop an idea or topic
*   Where possible or necessary (i.e., if an idea can be considered as “start” of a new note sequence, but does fit into the current linear argumentation), branch off a new idea-path
*   Check if similar topic or “story line” has been written down elsewhere; if yes, add manual links / references
*   Identify relevant notes that function as “starting” point and tag these notes
