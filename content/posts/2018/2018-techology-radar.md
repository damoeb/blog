In a larger Team it might be difficult to keep your technology stack up to date and have a vision of what things should be used soon or not. Moreover this knowledge is difficult to be shared, to let team members know what the other members think should be e.g. evaluated. Technology radars ([thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools) or [zalando](https://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/)) is a good visualization to keep that overview on what technologies should be hold, assessed, tested or adopted.   [![Screen Shot 2018-02-12 at 11.18.37.png](/blog/tech-radar-zalando.thumb.png)](/blog/tech-radar-zalando.png) [via](https://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/)   I really like this implementation of a radar called [tech rating](http://techrating.org), cause it also covers a reject category and a voting.
