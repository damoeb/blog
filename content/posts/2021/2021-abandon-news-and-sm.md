# Don't read the news

The internet is about content distribution and as a major source
 of content we have to talk about news. News provider networks usually rely on advertisement revenue streams 
 which leads to a conflict of interest. The more user read their news, the higher their revenue will be. Therefore 
 ([Why fake news spread faster than real news](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psychoanalysis-unplugged/201804/why-does-fake-news-spread-faster-real-news)) 
they tend to spread emotions instead of facts. Emotions are triggered using click-bait strategies, fake news or by using 
headline that invite to engage ([Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines)).

News in general are a bad source of information: about 80% of its content is [written by PR agencies](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/nov/17/mondaymediasection3) 
and they absorb your energy and distract you from things that really matter in your life ([News is bad for you â€“ and giving up reading it will make you happier](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli)).

Social Media is no way out, cause suffer from the same conflict of interests and moreover use highly elaborated [dark patterns](https://phys.org/news/2018-04-dark-secrets-social-media-patterns.html)
to keep you locked-in into your social media bubble. Their interest is not to educate or inform you with relevant things.
The worst of all is twitter, where to me it feels like everyone is cultivating their [id-persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego).
I never got any value from it.

# Problems over Problems
So there are many issues with the current way we provide ourselfs with information. 

1. Why do we care so much about recent content - namely news - and not in a similar way about historic, timeless content? Apparently a major goal for 
most people is to get distracted from reality and they are fine with it. 

2. Manipulative content embedded in advertisement that does not get to the point is common. 

3. We have externalized curating of sources and content. 

4. The amount of [content is infinite](http://www.pivotmethod.com/podcast/make-time) you will easily loose focus.

5. Privacy is not protected.

If you are just looking for distraction and you don't care about not being manipulated by content and ads, I have no 
solution to offer to you. 


# Feeds as the Solution
Abandoning news and social media for the purpose of getting relevant information is inevitable. 
A huge value social media companies get from offering their "free" services is network data and quality assessments. 
- no ads
- no SM 

## Choose quality content over speed

## Your Network is precious
RSS feeds are a crucial ingredience of the free and open web.
