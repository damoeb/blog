The initial goal was to build a comment platform similar to reddit, later I tried to tackle some user experience problems of larger discussion threads. Large threads are usually difficult to navigate and relevant information is usually by far outweighed by irrelevant data. The solution was a visualization in combination with a comment score, as you can see the [live kalipo demo](/reddit/#/discussion/top?url=https:%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fworldnews%2Fcomments%2F3rlu3g%2Ffull_text_of_the_tpp_has_just_been_released) applied on a reddit thread.
