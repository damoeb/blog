> A person with a work life of, say, forty years will spend five years working and thirty-five managing. That implies an exceedingly tall, narrow hierarchy. Fifteen percent of the staff is doing work, with eighty-five percent managing. As little as ten percent of the cost could be spent on the workers, with ninety percent going to reward the managers.
