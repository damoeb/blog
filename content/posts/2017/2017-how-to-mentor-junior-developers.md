Every person should have a roadmap of things they want to achieve, shortterm, midterm and longterm. This is similar to a project, where proceed step by step towards those goals, a big picture.

## Personal Roadmap

For juniors this is the same, but they might not have that personal big picture.

*   Find out what they can and where they want to be, skill-wise
*   Help them to achieve those things (obviously if the project goals allow it)

## Daily work

There is quite some best practices out there - [here](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/138396/how-to-mentor-a-junior-developer) or [here](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/04/ask-stack-how-to-mentor-a-junior-developer-1/) - summarizing those, I want to emphasize the following ones.

*   Be a mentor and do the preparation step regularly. Plan a regular meeting outside of the office, i a cafe maybe.
*   Don't touch their keyboard
*   Plan their tasks with them
*   Do pair programming. This is especially helpful , because to describe the next steps, they need a plan.
*   Let them work alone.
*   Receive their feedback and give them feedback, e.g. via code reviews
*   Let them do mistakes

## Encourage Knowledge Management

*   Teach them how to do knowledge management
*   Encourage them to write blog post that document their planned work/past work. This will help them to place their current work in their personal roadmap big picture.
*   todo list
