This purely ironical, unfinished set of rules is written from a managers perspective. A micromanaging persons should be able to read them and justify her/his actions since I assume her/his intentions are good.

*   Communicate globally
*   Change concepts and requirements from time to time
*   Establish taboos
*   Autonomy is the enemy. Make sure problems have to be solved globally always, especially if they only occur locally.
*   People should follow a set of static rules, maybe derived from solutions to local problems, to prevent totally unlikely events. To make sure everyone is still on the glory path,
*   Interrupt regularly and request updates.
*   Do a blame game, if problems occurred by disrespecting the rule book. Since you are a skeptical, well thought and realistic person, for any necessary changes
*   Require heavy documentation before getting started. The documentation is the result of an analysis phase ([analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis)). In order to speed up the analysis process,
*   Request to join technical discussions and share your non-technical opinion.
*   Do ad-hoc meetings. Always.
*   Regular emergency work that forces developers to immediately stop their previous task. Because your experience learned you the engineers estimates are usually wrong,
*   Re-estimate their tasks.
*   Provide constructive feedback by saying things like "Can't you work more like them? Their results are always fine."
