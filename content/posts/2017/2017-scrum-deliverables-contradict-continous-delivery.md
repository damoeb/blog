Scrum is the first choice in most companies that want to be "agile". Aside some fundamental drawbacks of scrum as outlined in <a href="https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2015/06/06/why-agile-and-especially-scrum-are-terrible/">Why "Agile" and especially Scrum is terrible</a>, there is one outstanding problem that contradicts scrum if you want to do continuous delivery. One of goals of scrum is to finalize deliverables for every iteration (sprint). During these sprint the developers should be able to work without any interruptions. This may work fine for an unreleased product, but as soon, a customer gets it in his hands, you will have to deal with product maintenance and production defects.

According to sprint a fix for a defect/maintenace would have to wait at least until the next sprint.

A solution could be kanban, which has the nice sideeffect that it is more development driven.
