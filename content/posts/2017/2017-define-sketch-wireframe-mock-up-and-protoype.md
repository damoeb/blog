*   **Sketch**Â Any representation of a user interface as a drawing.
*   **Wireframe** A static representation of a user interface where the individual elements are at least roughly where they are supposed to go, at their supposed sizes.
*   **Mock-up** A (usually static) representation of a user interface where decorations like shadows and colors are introduced.
*   **Prototype** Any representation of a product that is not the final product.
