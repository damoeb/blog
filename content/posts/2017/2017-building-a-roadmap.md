some notes on the inspiring presentation on [the art of building a roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlxcdzbqslm).

## preparation

before getting started with roadmapping, know your inputs like company goals, product vision and the business model. especially the business model input is interesting to vot for feature a and not feature b.

## roadmapping

*   **goal driven to optimize.** formulated as a problem and not as a solution () or a metric (leads to trial and error approach). group problems into themes (topics)

> teams that fall i love with a problem have more successful outcomes than teams that fall i love with particular solutions. (julie zhuo)

*   **persona driven to focus on a person.** who is this roadmap item for? the secretary? the student? this will bring better decisions, improved understanding and feedback.
*   **vision driven for new features.** the author recommends to outline "tent pegs" that define the scope of the feature.
